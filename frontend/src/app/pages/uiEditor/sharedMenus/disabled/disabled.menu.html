<!-- DISABLED? -->
<!-- logic: The (change) event is fired after the toggle is already changed
      Example: It is currently checked and the user clicks on it, then is is not checked anymore
              Then the (change) event fires and sees that itself is currently NOT CHECKED
              and calls the setProp() accordingly. -->
